# Loops Lab, Part I

It's time to get in some repetitions building `for` and `while` loops!

## Instructions

You will be writing a number of functions that will require you to use `for` or `while` loops. Each function says which looping syntax is required. Keep in mind that for each of the functions, you will need to return an array.

Use the JSDoc syntax and tests to help guide you.

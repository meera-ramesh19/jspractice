# Collaborative Programming

As a new hire, your company wants you to work with another Junior Developer to solve some quick functions to get the hang of pairing. For this Lab, focus on the process of pairing.

## Instructions

Write the functions in `index.js` as described by the related comments.

For each function, pick a driver and a navigator. After you get a function's tests to pass, switch roles. While pairing, keep in mind the following:

- Talk _a lot_ about potential solutions and ask _a lot_ of questions if there's something you don't understand.
- The driver should do the majority of the typing while the navigator is engaged and looking up information if needed.
- One person should not take over at any point. Work together the entire time!

# Evaluating Expressions

_Kim's Tea Shop_ is having a few issues with their code. A member of their team has written a few functions but none of them are working as intended. They need you to help fix their code, so that they can get back to what they do best -- selling tea!

## Instructions

You will be fixing five functions in the `index.js` file. Each function has an associated test which is currently failing. For each function, you need to get the tests to pass. For each function, you should only need to make a few edits to get the function to run correctly.

In the `__tests__/index.test.js` file, notice the `teas` variable and what it is being assigned to. This is the input that is used throughout the tests.

Read through the `index.js` file and the tests to understand the scope of what you'll need to build. Additionally, you can take a look at the examples below.

## Tips

- Each of functions has a problem with how certain expressions are being evaluated.
- The test output should give you a lot of help for many of the problems.

# Scope

Scoping issues can be difficult to debug. In this Lab, you will fix two functions that have some issues related to scoping.

## Instructions

Update the functions in the `index.js` file so that all of the tests pass. The function has already been solved -- you should not need to solve it once again. Instead, focus on fixing issues related to scope. Remember to read the output from the tests to determine what is going wrong.

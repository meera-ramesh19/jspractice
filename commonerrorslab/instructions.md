# Common Errors

A new hire at the popular video game company _Quadragon_, you've been tasked with cleaning up a bit of a mess that someone else left behind. At least the tests are working! Fix the errors in the file so that all of the functions run properly.

## Instructions

Update the code inside of the `index.js` file so that all of the tests pass. There are a variety of errors in the code, including "silent" errors that will cause failures but may not cause an explicit error to show.

Use the JSDoc style comments, the tests, and the output to guide you.
